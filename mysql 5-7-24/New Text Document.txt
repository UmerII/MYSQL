
Sure, here's how you can create two tables (Student and Teacher), perform an inner join between them, and then create a procedure for the inner join:

sql
Copy code
-- Create the Student table
CREATE TABLE Student (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Age INT,
    Class VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Insert some sample data into the Student table
INSERT INTO Student (StudentID, Name, Age, Class)
VALUES
    (1, 'John', 18, '10th'),
    (2, 'Emily', 17, '11th'),
    (3, 'Michael', 16, '9th');

-- Create the Teacher table
CREATE TABLE Teacher (
    TeacherID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Subject VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Insert some sample data into the Teacher table
INSERT INTO Teacher (TeacherID, Name, Subject)
VALUES
    (101, 'Mr. Smith', 'Math'),
    (102, 'Ms. Johnson', 'English'),
    (103, 'Dr. Patel', 'Science');

-- Create the InnerJoinProcedure
CREATE PROCEDURE InnerJoinProcedure
AS
BEGIN
    -- Declare variables to store the result set
    DECLARE @Result TABLE (
        StudentName VARCHAR(100),
        StudentAge INT,
        StudentClass VARCHAR(50),
        TeacherName VARCHAR(100),
        Subject VARCHAR(50)
    )

    -- Perform the inner join and insert the result into the @Result table
    INSERT INTO @Result (StudentName, StudentAge, StudentClass, TeacherName, Subject)
    SELECT s.Name AS StudentName, s.Age AS StudentAge, s.Class AS StudentClass,
           t.Name AS TeacherName, t.Subject
    FROM Student s
    INNER JOIN Teacher t ON s.Class = t.Subject

    -- Return the result set
    SELECT * FROM @Result
END
This script first creates the Student and Teacher tables, inserts sample data into them, and then defines a stored procedure named InnerJoinProcedure.
 This procedure performs an inner join between
 the Student and Teacher tables based on the condition Student.Class = Teacher.Subject,
 and returns the result set with columns such as StudentName, StudentAge, StudentClass, TeacherName, and Subject.

Creating procedures for all SQL commands would be quite extensive, but I can certainly provide examples for some common SQL commands:

SELECT Procedure:
sql
Copy code
CREATE PROCEDURE SelectProcedure
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM TableName;
END;
INSERT Procedure:
sql
Copy code
CREATE PROCEDURE InsertProcedure
    @Column1 DATATYPE,
    @Column2 DATATYPE,
    ...
AS
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO TableName (Column1, Column2, ...)
    VALUES (@Column1, @Column2, ...);
END;
UPDATE Procedure:
sql
Copy code
CREATE PROCEDURE UpdateProcedure
    @ID INT,
    @NewValue DATATYPE
AS
BEGIN
    UPDATE TableName
    SET Column = @NewValue
    WHERE ID = @ID;
END;
DELETE Procedure:
sql
Copy code
CREATE PROCEDURE DeleteProcedure
    @ID INT
AS
BEGIN
    DELETE FROM TableName
    WHERE ID = @ID;
END
use above table
ChatGPT
Sure, I'll demonstrate procedures for the SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE commands using the previously defined Student and Teacher tables, and then provide a procedure for INNER JOIN.

SELECT Procedure:
sql
Copy code
CREATE PROCEDURE SelectStudentsProcedure
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM Student;
END;
INSERT Procedure:
sql
Copy code
CREATE PROCEDURE InsertStudentProcedure
    @Name VARCHAR(100),
    @Age INT,
    @Class VARCHAR(50)
AS
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO Student (Name, Age, Class)
    VALUES (@Name, @Age, @Class);
END;
UPDATE Procedure:
sql
Copy code
CREATE PROCEDURE UpdateStudentAgeProcedure
    @StudentID INT,
    @NewAge INT
AS
BEGIN
    UPDATE Student
    SET Age = @NewAge
    WHERE StudentID = @StudentID;
END;
DELETE Procedure:
sql
Copy code
CREATE PROCEDURE DeleteStudentProcedure
    @StudentID INT
AS
BEGIN
    DELETE FROM Student
    WHERE StudentID = @StudentID;
END;
INNER JOIN Procedure:
sql
Copy code
CREATE PROCEDURE InnerJoinStudentsTeachersProcedure
AS
BEGIN
    -- Declare variables to store the result set
    DECLARE @Result TABLE (
        StudentName VARCHAR(100),
        StudentAge INT,
        StudentClass VARCHAR(50),
        TeacherName VARCHAR(100),
        Subject VARCHAR(50)
    )

    -- Perform the inner join and insert the result into the @Result table
    INSERT INTO @Result (StudentName, StudentAge, StudentClass, TeacherName, Subject)
    SELECT s.Name AS StudentName, s.Age AS StudentAge, s.Class AS StudentClass,
           t.Name AS TeacherName, t.Subject
    FROM Student s
    INNER JOIN Teacher t ON s.Class = t.Subject

    -- Return the result set
    SELECT * FROM @Result
END;
These procedures perform the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the Student table and demonstrate how to perform an INNER JOIN between Student and Teacher tables.

make for left join right join multiple join
ChatGPT
Certainly! Below are procedures for performing LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and multiple JOINs (combining LEFT JOIN and INNER JOIN) using the Student and Teacher tables:

LEFT JOIN Procedure:
sql
Copy code
CREATE PROCEDURE LeftJoinStudentsTeachersProcedure
AS
BEGIN
    -- Declare variables to store the result set
    DECLARE @Result TABLE (
        StudentName VARCHAR(100),
        StudentAge INT,
        StudentClass VARCHAR(50),
        TeacherName VARCHAR(100),
        Subject VARCHAR(50)
    )

    -- Perform the left join and insert the result into the @Result table
    INSERT INTO @Result (StudentName, StudentAge, StudentClass, TeacherName, Subject)
    SELECT s.Name AS StudentName, s.Age AS StudentAge, s.Class AS StudentClass,
           ISNULL(t.Name, 'No Teacher') AS TeacherName, t.Subject
    FROM Student s
    LEFT JOIN Teacher t ON s.Class = t.Subject

    -- Return the result set
    SELECT * FROM @Result
END;
RIGHT JOIN Procedure:
sql
Copy code
CREATE PROCEDURE RightJoinStudentsTeachersProcedure
AS
BEGIN
    -- Declare variables to store the result set
    DECLARE @Result TABLE (
        StudentName VARCHAR(100),
        StudentAge INT,
        StudentClass VARCHAR(50),
        TeacherName VARCHAR(100),
        Subject VARCHAR(50)
    )

    -- Perform the right join and insert the result into the @Result table
    INSERT INTO @Result (StudentName, StudentAge, StudentClass, TeacherName, Subject)
    SELECT ISNULL(s.Name, 'No Student') AS StudentName, ISNULL(s.Age, 0) AS StudentAge, ISNULL(s.Class, 'No Class') AS StudentClass,
           t.Name AS TeacherName, t.Subject
    FROM Student s
    RIGHT JOIN Teacher t ON s.Class = t.Subject

    -- Return the result set
    SELECT * FROM @Result
END;
Multiple JOINs (LEFT JOIN + INNER JOIN) Procedure:
sql
Copy code
CREATE PROCEDURE MultipleJoinStudentsTeachersProcedure
AS
BEGIN
    -- Declare variables to store the result set
    DECLARE @Result TABLE (
        StudentName VARCHAR(100),
        StudentAge INT,
        StudentClass VARCHAR(50),
        TeacherName VARCHAR(100),
        Subject VARCHAR(50)
    )

    -- Perform the multiple join and insert the result into the @Result table
    INSERT INTO @Result (StudentName, StudentAge, StudentClass, TeacherName, Subject)
    SELECT s.Name AS StudentName, s.Age AS StudentAge, s.Class AS StudentClass,
           t.Name AS TeacherName, t.Subject
    FROM Student s
    LEFT JOIN Teacher t ON s.Class = t.Subject
    INNER JOIN Teacher t2 ON s.Class = t2.Subject

    -- Return the result set
    SELECT * FROM @Result
END;
These procedures demonstrate LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and multiple JOINs using combinations of the Student and Teacher tables.
